I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Trinity College Dublin.

My research focuses on applied microeconomics, with particular interest in the intersection between media economics, norms, political economy, and leveraging machine learning techniques for text analysis.

Feel free to check out my CV for more details about my work and academic background.
