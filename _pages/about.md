I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Trinity College Dublin. I am on the 2026 economics job market.

My [research](/research/) focuses on applied microeconomics, with particular interest in the intersection of Media Economics and the Political Economy, the evolution of norms, and the economics of AI.

My [ML projects](/projects/) focus on the creation of large-scale historical text datasets using advanced machine learning techniques, including neural networks and transformer models. 

Feel free to check out my [CV](/cv/) for more details about my work and academic background.
