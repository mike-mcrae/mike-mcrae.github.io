I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Trinity College Dublin.

My [research](/research/) focuses on applied microeconomics, with particular interest in media economics, the evolution of norms, and political economy.

My data [projects](/projects/) focus on the creation of large-scale historical text datasets using advanced machine learning techniques, including neural networks and transformer models. I experiment with deep learning architectures to process and classify millions of newspaper articles, applying tools such as BERT, YOLO, and BERTopic for entity recognition, topic modeling, and layout detection. My projects involve developing custom pipelines for web scraping, optical character recognition (OCR), and automated text correction to produce high-quality datasets for historical and social science research.

Feel free to check out my [CV](/cv/) for more details about my work and academic background.
