I study how a call from US Black Civil Rights leaders in the 1960’s to change the the label ‘Negro’ to using the label ‘Black’ with respect to black people, effects local newspaper use of the same terms. I provide evidence that out-group preferences as measured by existing local levels of White racial conservatism predicts the level of adjustment to the new label. This effect is exacerbated in the face of, and intensity of local newspaper market competition. These findings suggest the reinforcing effect that news media might have on the biases of the dominant consumer groups, especially in the face of competition.
