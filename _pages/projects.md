## Southern Newswire Corpus - Historical Wire Articles (1960–1975)  
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/mikemcrae/southern-newswire) 🚀  
The **Southern Newswire Corpus** is a large-scale dataset of historical wire articles from U.S. Southern newspapers, spanning **1960–1975**. It covers multiple wire services (**AP**, **UPI**, and **NEA**) and offers both **raw OCR** and **LLM-corrected** versions.

### Highlights:
- **Neural Networks**: Used a fine-tuned BERT model to identify wire services.
- **Machine Learning for OCR Correction**: Leveraged Llama 3.2 to correct noisy OCR outputs.
- **Article Clustering**: Employed Sentence-BERT embeddings to detect shared wire dispatches.
- **Topic Modeling**: Used LDA and BERTopic to identify news themes.

**Final Dataset:** 9.57 million wire articles detected from 58 million total articles.

## 🛠️ Project 2 - Coming Soon  
Placeholder for a future project on **Neural Networks**, **Machine Learning OCR**, or other exciting work! Stay tuned for updates. 😊
