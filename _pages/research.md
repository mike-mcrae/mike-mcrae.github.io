<span style="color: orange;"><b>1. Black by Popular Demand: Media, Competition and the Evolution of a Social Norm [Solo-Authored]</b></span> [Latest Draft](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/5rc12c27n73s4t93m2rrt/Black-by-Popular-Demand-Media-Competition-and-the-Evolution-of-a-Social-Norm.pdf?rlkey=v18efnxlps72bwb59faut65qo&dl=0)

<p style="text-align: justify;">
What role do economic incentives play in social change? I study how market forces shaped newspapers’ adoption of a new identity label, exploiting a Civil Rights era campaign in the mid-1960s that sought to shift usage from "Negro" to "Black". I introduce an original dataset created by digitising 58 million newspaper articles from 450 Southern newspapers (1960–1973) and 1964 newspaper circulation audits, yielding measures of newspaper–county circulation flows and local market competition. I show that Southern newspapers began adopting "Black" almost immediately after the shock, and that its use brought more affirmative and agentic portrayals of Black individuals, consistent with the label’s intended meaning. Adoption patterns varied systematically: newspapers facing racially conservative audiences were slower to adjust, and this resistance was amplified in more competitive local markets, where outlets had stronger incentives to align with audience preferences. These effects are not explained by editorial ideology or ownership. Finally, in counties covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, earlier adoption of "Black” predicted faster growth in Black local officeholding between 1966 and 1974. The findings show how economic incentives in media markets can either accelerate or hinder norm change, depending on how they interact with underlying audience attitudes and market structure.

<!-- What role do economic incentives play in social change? I study how media, responding to market pressures, shapes the evolution of an identity-based norm. Leveraging an exogenous shift in language preferences for the term 'Black' instead of 'Negro,' triggered by Black Civil Rights leaders in the mid-1960s, I examine what drives local newspapers' responses. I introduce an original dataset created by digitising 58 million newspaper articles from 450 Southern newspapers (1960–1973) and 1964 newspaper circulation audits, yielding measures of newspaper–county circulation flows and local market competition. First, I show that diffusion of the "Black" label in US Southern newspapers began immediately after this shock and that when the "Black" label is adopted, media representation of Black entities is immediately and persistently aligned with the identity intended by the "Black" campaign leaders. I then provide evidence that newspapers' demand-side exposure to White racial conservatism predicts both lower and slower adjustment to the new label, and that this effect is exacerbated by the intensity of local newspaper market competition. I show that the effect is not driven by local journalists, editors or companies' policies. Finally, I show that counties whose papers embraced “Black” earlier, in areas covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, experienced significantly faster growth in Black local officeholding between 1966 and 1974, suggesting that symbolic shifts in white-oriented media translated into tangible gains in Black political incorporation. This paper highlights how economic incentives within media markets can slow the diffusion of evolving norms, particularly when these norms challenge entrenched attitudes within the majority. -->

**2. Vertical Governance of Online Speech: Evidence from Google’s Moderation Mandate [Solo-Authored]**
[Latest Draft](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4syz4glhavu1o07lmroey/0.-Vertical-Governance-of-Online-Speech.pdf?rlkey=wn1w7um4q8xx11ceqdgp9zlt9&dl=0)

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This paper shows that infrastructure providers can reshape online discourse by enforcing moderation through access-based leverage. Exploiting Google’s 2022 Play Store policy update in a triple-differences design across three alternative social media platforms, I find sharp and persistent declines in threatening content, especially among high-risk users. Politically sensitive narratives such as election denial also fell, highlighting how infrastructure-level enforcement can redefine the boundaries of online speech.

<!-- This paper provides the first causal evidence that upstream infrastructure providers can reshape social media discourse by enforcing content moderation through access-based leverage. I develop a simple vertical governance model showing how a distributor trades off scandal risk and enforcement costs when setting moderation thresholds, and how platforms decide whether to comply or exit. Guided by this framework, I exploit a 2022 update to Google’s Play Store policy requiring stricter removal of violent threats and misinformation, along with variation in platform exposure across three similar 'Alt-Tech' social media platforms, within a triple-differences design. Using a novel panel of over 28 million posts from 62,000 users, I find that threatening content declined sharply and persistently on the exposed platforms, particularly among high-risk users. These effects are not explained by user self-censorship, public awareness, contemporaneous events, or selective data loss. I also document significant reductions in lawful but politically sensitive narratives, including election denial and January 6 insurrection commentary. The findings show how infrastructure-level enforcement can durably alter the boundaries of permissible speech across platforms, contributing to literatures on platform governance, vertical restraints in digital markets, and the institutional foundations of online discourse. -->

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This project examines how voters and policymakers respond to external threats, focusing on the political and military consequences of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Using novel measures of local media exposure and exogenous variation in threat salience, we estimate the crisis’s impact on electoral participation, partisan support, congressional behavior, and military service.

**4. From the Pulpit to the Polls: The Electoral Consequences of Christian Talk Radio [Solo-Authored]**
[Draft Coming Soon!]
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This paper studies the political effects of Christian-conservative radio expansion in the United States. Using variation in radio signal strength driven by topography and station acquisitions, I link exposure to county-level voting records and evangelical presence. Greater exposure increased Republican vote share, especially in areas with larger evangelical populations, highlighting how deregulation enabled partisan religious media to shape electoral outcomes.
