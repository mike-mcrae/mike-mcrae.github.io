### <u>Media, Norms and Political Economy</u>
**Black is the new Black - Media competition and slanted language**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I explore the effect of out-group preferences and newspaper market competition on newspaper adoption of a new minority group label. I exploit a call from US Black Civil Rights leaders in the 1960s to change the label ‘Negro’ to ‘Black’ when referring to Black people and measure local newspapers' use of the same terms in the US South. I introduce two novel datasets: (1) a corpus of ~200 million newspaper articles from ~1,000 newspapers spanning the period 1960-1973, and (2) a digitized database of newspaper county-level circulation from 1964. I provide evidence that the label change campaign launch constitutes a shock to local newspaper output, that existing local levels of White racial conservatism predicts slower adjustment to the new label and that this effect is exacerbated in the intensity of local newspaper market competition. These findings suggest the reinforcing effect that news media might have on the biases of dominant consumer groups, especially in the face of competition.

**The Google Nanny & Truth Social - Moderation of toxic content by downstream supply chains**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I explore whether downstream supply chains can impact the moderation of social media platforms and offline behavior, using the case study of the alt-right social media platform Truth Social. Analyzing toxicity and threats from over 5 million posts by more than 11,000 users, I exploit an initial rejection of Truth Social’s mobile application to be made available on Google Play due to non-compliance with Google's threat minimisation policies. I show that following the rejection, threatening content on Truth Social significantly reduced. The effect is increasing in pre-rejection user-toxicty and appears to be driven by the removal of threatening posts by platform moderators. Then, utilizing pre-treatment search engine interest in Truth Social and conflict data, I show that regions with higher penetration of Truth Social experience a reduction in political and civilian violence.

**US talk radio and christian voting**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I study how the expansion of a radio empire with a Christian nationalist agenda impacted Christian voter turnout and election results in the US during the 1990s and 2000s. I collect novel data on the timing of the expansion, technical specifications, and geographic locations of the affiliated radio stations, and account for the influence of topography and physical obstacles on radio signal strength by using a radio signal propagation model.

### <u>Climate Change</u>

**Selective Science: How Media Bias Shapes Climate Change Narratives (Joint with M. Pograxha)**

We investigate how the alignment between scientific narratives in academic articles about climate change and the priors of media consumers influences newspaper coverage. Using a comprehensive dataset of academic papers, media outlets’ political alignments, and metrics of article quality, we explore whether media outlets selectively highlight scientific evidence that confirms their audience's preconceptions, regardless of its quality. By analyzing the framing, frequency, and credibility of referenced articles, we reveal how media coverage can amplify or distort climate narratives, potentially spreading false claims aligned with consumer priors. This research informs our understanding of how media shapes public perceptions of climate science and highlights pathways for improving the dissemination of accurate scientific information, ultimately aiding in the design of more effective climate policies.

**Climate on the Move: How Migration Imports Beliefs on Climate Change (Joint with M. Pograxha and E. Cavallotti)**

We examine how climate shock-induced migration shapes the exchange of climate change beliefs across borders. Focusing on outward migration from regions increasingly affected by climate shocks, we analyze how these migrants influence perceptions of climate change in their new communities, particularly in the United States. By integrating data on migration corridors, climate shocks, and public opinion, we explore whether the arrival of climate-conscious individuals amplifies awareness and acceptance of climate science. This research sheds light on the intersection of migration, climate change, and belief formation, offering insights into how global mobility can drive cultural and policy shifts in the face of environmental challenges.

**Tracing the Roots of Flood Risk: How Hedgerow Removal Reshaped France’s Landscape (Joint with V. Thorne)**

We investigate how the systematic removal of hedgerows in France over the past century has impacted flood risk and water management. Using a unique dataset of aerial imagery spanning from the post-WWII period to the present, we employ advanced machine learning techniques to map changes in hedgerow density across the countryside. By integrating these spatial datasets with hydrological records and flood event data, we analyze how the loss of these natural barriers has influenced surface water retention, soil erosion, and downstream flooding. This research combines historical land use patterns with contemporary environmental challenges, offering insights into how landscape management practices can mitigate or exacerbate the effects of extreme weather events. All datasets, including aerial imagery and flood records, are openly available and linked to foster transparency and collaboration in addressing flood resilience.

### <u>Development</u>
**When to baseline - The impact of lottery allocation household outcomes in a highly vulnerable setting (Joint with C. M. Fernandez, A. Guariso, M. Holmlund, T. Mitchell, and C. Newman.)**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
It is considered 'good practice' to collect a baseline survey for the purposes of improving statistical power, assessing baseline randomised group balance, and correcting for possible attrition, as well as for the purposes of heterogeneity analysis at end-line. However, it is common in field experiments to randomise treatment status in the public domain to allow community and government scrutiny of the 'fairness' of allocation. This approach can create constraints on the timing of baseline survey implementation. We analyse whether public lottery allocation effects respondents' outcomes in a sample of villages in Niger.
