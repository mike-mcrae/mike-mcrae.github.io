**Black by Popular Demand: Media, Competition and the Evolution of a Social Norm**
[Latest Draft](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/5rc12c27n73s4t93m2rrt/Black-by-Popular-Demand-Media-Competition-and-the-Evolution-of-a-Social-Norm.pdf?rlkey=v18efnxlps72bwb59faut65qo&dl=0)

<p style="text-align: justify;">
What role do economic incentives play in social change? I study how media, responding to market pressures, shapes the evolution of an identity-based norm. Leveraging an exogenous shift in language preferences for the term `Black' instead of `Negro,' triggered by Black Civil Rights leaders in the mid-1960s, I examine what drives local newspapers' responses. I introduce an original dataset created by digitising 58 million newspaper articles from 450 Southern newspapers (1960–1973) and 1964 newspaper circulation audits, yielding measures of newspaper–county circulation flows and local market competition. First, I show that diffusion of the ``Black'' label in US Southern newspapers began immediately after this shock and that when the ``Black'' label is adopted, media representation of Black entities is immediately and persistently aligned with the identity intended by the ``Black'' campaign leaders. I then provide evidence that newspapers' demand-side exposure to White racial conservatism predicts both lower and slower adjustment to the new label, and that this effect is exacerbated by the intensity of local newspaper market competition. I show that the effect is not driven by local journalists, editors or companies' policies. Finally, I show that counties whose papers embraced “Black” earlier, in areas covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, experienced significantly faster growth in Black local officeholding between 1966 and 1974, suggesting that symbolic shifts in white-oriented media translated into tangible gains in Black political incorporation. This paper highlights how economic incentives within media markets can slow the diffusion of evolving norms, particularly when these norms challenge entrenched attitudes within the majority.

**Vertical Governance of Online Speech: Evidence from Google’s Moderation Mandate**
[Latest Draft](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4syz4glhavu1o07lmroey/0.-Vertical-Governance-of-Online-Speech.pdf?rlkey=wn1w7um4q8xx11ceqdgp9zlt9&dl=0)

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This paper provides the first causal evidence that upstream infrastructure providers can reshape social media discourse by enforcing content moderation through access-based leverage. I develop a simple vertical governance model showing how a distributor trades off scandal risk and enforcement costs when setting moderation thresholds, and how platforms decide whether to comply or exit. Guided by this framework, I exploit a 2022 update to Google’s Play Store policy requiring stricter removal of violent threats and misinformation, along with variation in platform exposure across three similar `Alt-Tech' social media platforms, within a triple-differences design. Using a novel panel of over 28 million posts from 62,000 users, I find that threatening content declined sharply and persistently on the exposed platforms, particularly among high-risk users. These effects are not explained by user self-censorship, public awareness, contemporaneous events, or selective data loss. I also document significant reductions in lawful but politically sensitive narratives, including election denial and January 6 insurrection commentary. The findings show how infrastructure-level enforcement can durably alter the boundaries of permissible speech across platforms, contributing to literatures on platform governance, vertical restraints in digital markets, and the institutional foundations of online discourse.

**From the Pulpit to the Polls: The Electoral Consequences of Christian Talk Radio**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This paper examines the impact of Salem Communications’ rapid expansion of Christian-conservative radio on voter turnout and Republican vote share in U.S. presidential elections. Leveraging data on station acquisitions, technical specifications, and local topography, I identify exogenous variation in radio signal strength using a strategy adapted from Olken (2009). I construct counterfactual signal-strength measures for each county in the absence of terrain obstacles and compare them to observed reception, thereby isolating the portion of Salem’s broadcasts plausibly unrelated to underlying political trends. Linking these signal data to county-level voting records and measures of evangelical congregations, I find that increased Salem exposure is associated with a statistically significant rise in the Republican share of the vote. Results suggest that areas with sizeable evangelical populations are more sensitive to conservative radio programming, revealing the role religiously oriented media can play in political mobilisation. By highlighting how regulatory changes, particularly the end of the Fairness Doctrine and the 1996 Telecommunications Act, enabled the proliferation of partisan radio networks, the findings contribute to a broader literature on media influence, religious mobilisation, and electoral behaviour.

**The Introduction and Reduction of Estimation Bias in AI Assisted Research**

 When do societal and historical biases introduce measurement error in LLM assisted research? How can we reduce or eliminate these biases? In this paper, I demonstrate how careful methodological design can leverage the power of LLMs while preserving objectivity, thereby enhancing the reliability of AI-assisted textual analysis in economics and the social sciences.

**Editorial Bias: Evidence from Historical Newspapers**

This paper provides evidence of racial biases in newspaper editor content decisions. It examines subtle variation in language choice across newspapers when publishing the same underlying wire articles, revealing systematic differences in editorial choices. 

**Selective Science: How Media Bias Shapes Climate Change Narratives (Joint with M. Pograxha)**

We investigate how the alignment between scientific narratives in academic articles about climate change and the priors of media consumers influences newspaper coverage. Using a comprehensive dataset of academic papers, media outlets’ political alignments, and metrics of article quality, we explore whether media outlets selectively highlight scientific evidence that confirms their audience's priors, independent of quality.  This research informs our understanding of how media shapes public perceptions of climate science and highlights pathways for improving the dissemination of accurate scientific information.

**When to baseline - The impact of lottery allocation household outcomes in a highly vulnerable setting (Joint with C. M. Fernandez, A. Guariso, M. Holmlund, T. Mitchell, and C. Newman.)**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
It is considered 'good practice' to collect a baseline survey for the purposes of improving statistical power, assessing baseline randomised group balance, and correcting for possible attrition, as well as for the purposes of heterogeneity analysis at end-line. However, it is common in field experiments to randomise treatment status in the public domain to allow community and government scrutiny of the 'fairness' of allocation. This approach can create constraints on the timing of baseline survey implementation. We analyse whether public lottery allocation effects respondents' outcomes in a sample of villages in Niger.
