### <u>Media, Norms and Political Economy</u>
**Black is the new Black - Media competition and slanted language**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I explore the effect of out-group preferences and newspaper market competition on newspaper adoption of a new minority group label. I exploit a call from US Black Civil Rights leaders in the 1960s to change the label ‘Negro’ to ‘Black’ when referring to Black people, and measure local newspaper use of the same terms in the US Deep South. I introduce two novel datasets: (1) a corpus of ~200 million newspaper articles from ~1,000 newspapers spanning the period 1960-1973, and (2) a digitized database of newspaper town-level circulation from 1964. I provide evidence that the label change campaign launch constitutes a shock to local newspaper output, that out-group preferences as measured by existing local levels of White racial conservatism predicts the level of adjustment to the new label and that this effect is exacerbated in the face of, and intensity of local newspaper market competition. These findings suggest the reinforcing effect that news media might have on the biases of dominant consumer groups, especially in the face of competition.

**The Google Nanny & Truth Social - Moderation of toxic content by downstream supply chains**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I explore whether downstream supply chains can impact the moderation of social media platforms and offline behavior, using the case study of the alt-right social media platform Truth Social. Analyzing toxicity and threats from over 5 million posts by more than 11,000 users, I exploit an initial rejection of Truth Social’s mobile application to be made available on Google Play due to non-compliance with Google's threat minimisation policies. I show that following the rejection, threatening content on Truth Social significantly reduced. The effect is increasing in pre-rejection user-toxicty and appears to be driven by the removal of threatening posts by platform moderators. Then, utilizing pre-treatment search engine interest in Truth Social and conflict data, I show that regions with higher penetration of Truth Social experience a reduction in political and civilian violence.

**US talk radio and christian voting**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I study how the expansion of a radio empire with a Christian nationalist agenda impacted Christian voter turnout and election results in the US during the 1990s and 2000s. I collect novel data on the timing of the expansion, technical specifications, and geographic locations of the affiliated radio stations, and account for the influence of topography and physical obstacles on radio signal strength by using a radio signal propagation model.

### <u>Development</u>
**When to baseline - The impact of lottery allocation household outcomes in a highly vulnerable setting (Joint with C. M. Fernandez, A. Guariso, M. Holmlund, T. Mitchell, and C. Newman.)**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
It is considered 'good practice' to collect a baseline survey for the purposes of improving statistical power, assessing baseline randomised group balance, and correcting for possible attrition, as well as for the purposes of heterogeneity analysis at end-line. However, it is common in field experiments to randomise treatment status in the public domain to allow community and government scrutiny of the 'fairness' of allocation. This approach can create constraints on the timing of baseline survey implementation. We analyse whether public lottery allocation effects respondents' outcomes in a sample of villages in Niger.
