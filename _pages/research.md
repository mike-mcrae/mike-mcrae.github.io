**Black is the new Black - Media competition and slanted language (Solo project)**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I study how a call from US Black Civil Rights leaders in the 1960’s to change the the label ‘Negro’ to using the label ‘Black’ with respect to black people, effects local newspaper use of the same terms in the US Deep South. I introduce two novel datasets: (1) a corpus of ~200 million newspaper articles from ~1000 newspapers spanning the period 1960 - 1973, and (2) a digitised database of newspaper town level circulation from 1964. I provide evidence that the announcement by a single Black Civil Rights leader to change the term represents an exogenous shock to newspaper label choices. I then show that, following the shock, out-group preferences as measured by increasing existing local levels of White racial conservatism slows the level of adjustment to the new label. This effect is exacerbated in the face of, and intensity of local newspaper market competition. These findings suggest the reinforcing effect that news media may have on the biases of dominant consumer groups, especially in the face of competition.

**The Google Nanny & Truth Social - Moderation of toxic content by downstream supply chains (Solo project)**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I explore whether downstream supply chains can impact the moderation of social media platforms and offline behaviour using the case study of the alt-right social media platform Truth Social. Moderation of existing social media platforms has encouraged the rise of alternative products designed to avoid moderation. Many of these alternative platforms follow a traditional media model that depends heavily on advertising revenue, requiring them to engage a large number of users. Platforms largely rely on mobile applications to access users and the distribution of phone applications is dominated by two companies, Apple for iOS devices and Google for Android. These distributors have policies in place which prohibit the sale of applications that produce content that encourages violence. As such, these non-mainstream platforms face a trade-off. Ex-ante, which incentive dominates is not clear. Analysing toxicity and threats of >4 Mil. posts from >30,000 users, I show that, following an initial rejection of Truth Social application to be available on Google Play, threatening content on Truth Social significnatly reduced. The reduction appears to be driven by the removal of threataning posts by platform moderators. Then utilising pre-treatment search engine interest in Truth Social, and conflict data, I show that that regions with higher penetartion of Truth Social show a reduction in political and civilian violence.
