**Black by Popular Demand: Media, Competition and the Evolution of a Social Norm**
[Latest Draft](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/qvurfsbcafs500w61oe49/Black-by-Popular-Demand-Draft-November-2024.pdf?rlkey=076hdckzcmm5ehqus8hqw4rbz&st=7wmzf367&dl=0)

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Leveraging an exogenous shift in language preferences induced by mid-1960s calls from Black Civil Rights leaders to use the term “Black” instead of “Negro,” this paper examines how economic incentives shape local newspapers’ responses to evolving cultural norms. I introduce two novel datasets—a corpus of 58 million newspaper articles and a digitized database of county-level newspaper circulation from 1964—which I match to create a panel of 450 Southern newspapers spanning the period 1960-1973. I provide evidence that newspapers' demand-side exposure to out-group preferences—proxied by local levels of White racial conservatism—predicts both lower and slower adjustment to the new label, and that this effect is exacerbated by the intensity of local newspaper market competition. I show that the effect is not driven by local journalists, editors or companies' policies. I then, in a second stage, show that, when the ``Black'' label is adopted, media representation of Black entities is significantly, immediately and persistently aligned with the identity intended by the ``Black'' campaign leaders. This representation is less prominent in the face of increasing White racial conservatism and heterogeneous in the face of competition. This paper highlights how economic incentives within media markets can slow the diffusion of evolving norms, particularly when these norms challenge entrenched attitudes within the majority. My findings challenge the conventional view that competition inherently fosters diversity in media content, suggesting instead that it may deepen entrenched biases when minority preferences diverge from majority tastes.

### <u>Climate Change and Environmental Economics</u>

**Climate on the Move: How Migration Imports Beliefs on Climate Change (Joint with M. Pograxha and E. Cavallotti)**

We examine how climate shock-induced migration shapes the diffusion of climate change beliefs across international borders. Leveraging granular data on historical Mexican–U.S. migration corridors and local climate shocks in Mexico, we construct a shift-share instrument to isolate the exogenous component of migrant inflows to U.S. counties. By exploiting temporal variation in climate shocks across Mexican origin regions, our empirical strategy disentangles the causal effect of climate-induced migrant arrivals on the evolution of climate change acceptance within U.S. communities. Preliminary findings suggest that climate shocks abroad—transmitted through established migration networks—can meaningfully influence host populations’ environmental attitudes, underscoring global mobility’s role in shaping both cultural norms and policy preferences in an era of escalating environmental challenges.

**Selective Science: How Media Bias Shapes Climate Change Narratives (Joint with M. Pograxha)**

We investigate how the alignment between scientific narratives in academic articles about climate change and the priors of media consumers influences newspaper coverage. Using a comprehensive dataset of academic papers, media outlets’ political alignments, and metrics of article quality, we explore whether media outlets selectively highlight scientific evidence that confirms their audience's preconceptions, regardless of its quality. By analyzing the framing, frequency, and credibility of referenced articles, we reveal how media coverage can amplify or distort climate narratives, potentially spreading false claims aligned with consumer priors. This research informs our understanding of how media shapes public perceptions of climate science and highlights pathways for improving the dissemination of accurate scientific information, ultimately aiding in the design of more effective climate policies.


**Tracing the Roots of Flood Risk: How Hedgerow Removal Reshaped France’s Landscape (Joint with V. Thorne)**

We investigate how the systematic removal of hedgerows in France over the past century has impacted flood risk and water management. Using a unique dataset of aerial imagery spanning from the post-WWII period to the present, we employ advanced machine learning techniques to map changes in hedgerow density across the countryside. By integrating these spatial datasets with hydrological records and flood event data, we analyze how the loss of these natural barriers has influenced surface water retention, soil erosion, and downstream flooding. This research combines historical land use patterns with contemporary environmental challenges, offering insights into how landscape management practices can mitigate or exacerbate the effects of extreme weather events.

### <u>Media and Political Economy</u>

**The Google Nanny & Truth Social - Moderation of toxic content by downstream supply chains**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I explore whether downstream supply chains can impact the moderation of social media platforms and offline behavior, using the case study of the alt-right social media platform Truth Social. Analyzing toxicity and threats from over 5 million posts by more than 11,000 users, I exploit an initial rejection of Truth Social’s mobile application to be made available on Google Play due to non-compliance with Google's threat minimisation policies. I show that following the rejection, threatening content on Truth Social significantly reduced. The effect is increasing in pre-rejection user-toxicty and appears to be driven by the removal of threatening posts by platform moderators. Then, utilizing pre-treatment search engine interest in Truth Social and conflict data, I show that regions with higher penetration of Truth Social experience a reduction in political and civilian violence.

**US talk radio and christian voting**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I study how the expansion of a radio empire with a Christian nationalist agenda impacted Christian voter turnout and election results in the US during the 1990s and 2000s. I collect novel data on the timing of the expansion, technical specifications, and geographic locations of the affiliated radio stations, and account for the influence of topography and physical obstacles on radio signal strength by using a radio signal propagation model.

### <u>Development</u>
**When to baseline - The impact of lottery allocation household outcomes in a highly vulnerable setting (Joint with C. M. Fernandez, A. Guariso, M. Holmlund, T. Mitchell, and C. Newman.)**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
It is considered 'good practice' to collect a baseline survey for the purposes of improving statistical power, assessing baseline randomised group balance, and correcting for possible attrition, as well as for the purposes of heterogeneity analysis at end-line. However, it is common in field experiments to randomise treatment status in the public domain to allow community and government scrutiny of the 'fairness' of allocation. This approach can create constraints on the timing of baseline survey implementation. We analyse whether public lottery allocation effects respondents' outcomes in a sample of villages in Niger.
