<span style="color: orange;"><b>1. Black by Popular Demand: Media Competition and the Evolution of Identity</b></span> [Latest Draft](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/5rc12c27n73s4t93m2rrt/Black-by-Popular-Demand-Media-Competition-and-the-Evolution-of-Identity.pdf?rlkey=v18efnxlps72bwb59faut65qo&dl=0)


<p style="text-align: justify;">
What role do economic incentives play in social change? This paper examines this question through the lens of local newspaper markets during the U.S. Civil Rights era, following the emergence of the Black Power movement and the associated campaign to replace "Negro" with "Black." Combining text from Southern newspapers (1960–1973) and 1964 newspaper circulation audits, I show that the campaign constitutes a widespread and exogenous shock to media choice of label and narrative portrayal of Black individuals. Local market competition increased the elasticity of supply to ideological demand: accelerating label and narrative diffusion where audiences were receptive, but reinforcing inertia where they were resistant. These effects are not explained by editorial ideology or ownership. I then document that local markets exposed to earlier newspaper adoption of “Black” saw faster growth in Black local officeholding. The findings reveal how market incentives shape the diffusion of social and political movements.

<span style="color: orange;"><b>2. Vertical Governance of Online Speech: Evidence from Google’s Moderation Mandate</b></span> [Latest Draft](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/zoi7tfmuc382d3jfx6gjs/0.-Vertical-Governance-of-Online-Speech.pdf?rlkey=azz7r01rvaqqcb8rs6c8lauxg&dl=0)

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This paper shows that infrastructure providers can reshape online discourse by enforcing moderation through access-based leverage. Exploiting Google’s 2022 Play Store policy update in a triple-differences design across three alternative social media platforms, I find sharp and persistent declines in threatening content, especially among high-risk users. Politically sensitive narratives such as election denial also fell, highlighting how infrastructure-level enforcement can redefine the boundaries of online speech. I introduce a simple model of vertical governance to explain why distributors impose moderation requirements and why platforms choose either to comply or exit, clarifying the incentive trade-offs that underpin infrastructure-led enforcement.

<!-- This paper provides the first causal evidence that upstream infrastructure providers can reshape social media discourse by enforcing content moderation through access-based leverage. I develop a simple vertical governance model showing how a distributor trades off scandal risk and enforcement costs when setting moderation thresholds, and how platforms decide whether to comply or exit. Guided by this framework, I exploit a 2022 update to Google’s Play Store policy requiring stricter removal of violent threats and misinformation, along with variation in platform exposure across three similar 'Alt-Tech' social media platforms, within a triple-differences design. Using a novel panel of over 28 million posts from 62,000 users, I find that threatening content declined sharply and persistently on the exposed platforms, particularly among high-risk users. These effects are not explained by user self-censorship, public awareness, contemporaneous events, or selective data loss. I also document significant reductions in lawful but politically sensitive narratives, including election denial and January 6 insurrection commentary. The findings show how infrastructure-level enforcement can durably alter the boundaries of permissible speech across platforms, contributing to literatures on platform governance, vertical restraints in digital markets, and the institutional foundations of online discourse. -->

3. The Political Effects of Threats to the Nation: Evidence from the Cuban Missile Crisis <span style="font-weight: normal; color: #777; margin-left: 8px;"> [New draft coming soon] </span>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This project studies how citizens and political institutions respond to sudden, credible external threats. Using the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis as a natural experiment, and exploiting sharp geographic variation in perceived exposure to nuclear danger, we examine the crisis’s effects on electoral participation, partisan support, congressional behavior, and military service. Novel measures of local media exposure allow us to trace how threat salience translated into political and civic responses across U.S. communities.

### <u>Political Economy & Media</u>

<span style="color: orange;"><b>4. From the Pulpit to the Polls: The Electoral Consequences of Christian Talk Radio</b></span>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This paper studies the political effects of Christian-conservative radio expansion in the United States. Using variation in radio signal strength driven by topography and station acquisitions, I link exposure to county-level voting records and evangelical presence. Greater exposure increased Republican vote share, especially in areas with larger evangelical populations, highlighting how deregulation enabled partisan religious media to shape electoral outcomes.
