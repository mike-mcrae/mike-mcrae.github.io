**Black is the new Black - Media competition and slanted language**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I study how local newspaper market competition affects newspapers' response to a national consumer preference shock. I exploit a call from US Black Civil Rights leaders in the 1960s to change the label ‘Negro’ to ‘Black’ when referring to Black people, and measure local newspaper use of the same terms in the US Deep South. I introduce two novel datasets: (1) a corpus of ~200 million newspaper articles from ~1,000 newspapers spanning the period 1960-1973, and (2) a digitized database of newspaper town-level circulation from 1964. I provide evidence that the announcement by a single Black Civil Rights leader to change the term represents an exogenous shock to newspaper label choices. I then show that, following the shock, out-group preferences, as measured by increasing local levels of White racial conservatism, slow the level of adjustment to the new label. This effect is exacerbated by the existence and intensity of local newspaper market competition. These findings suggest the reinforcing effect that news media may have on the biases of dominant consumer groups, especially in the face of competition.

**The Google Nanny & Truth Social - Moderation of toxic content by downstream supply chains**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I explore whether downstream supply chains can impact the moderation of social media platforms and offline behavior, using the case study of the alt-right social media platform Truth Social. Moderation of existing social media platforms has encouraged the rise of alternative products designed to avoid moderation. Many of these alternative platforms follow a traditional media model that depends heavily on advertising revenue, requiring them to engage a large number of users. Social media platforms largely rely on a small number of mobile phone application distributors to reach consumers, and these distributors have policies in place that prohibit the sale of applications producing content encouraging violence. As such, these non-mainstream platforms face a trade-off. Ex-ante, which incentive dominates is not clear. Analyzing toxicity and threats from over 4 million posts by more than 30,000 users, I show that, following an initial rejection of Truth Social’s application on Google Play, threatening content on Truth Social significantly reduced. The reduction appears to be driven by the removal of threatening posts by platform moderators. Then, utilizing pre-treatment search engine interest in Truth Social and conflict data, I show that regions with higher penetration of Truth Social experience a reduction in political and civilian violence.

**US talk radio and christian voting**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I study how the expansion of a radio empire with a Christian nationalist agenda impacted Christian voter turnout and election results in the US during the 1990s and 2000s. I collect novel data on the timing of the expansion, technical specifications, and geographic locations of the affiliated radio stations, and account for the influence of topography and physical obstacles on radio signal strength by using a radio signal propagation model.

**When to baseline - The impact of lottery allocation household outcomes in a highly vulnerable setting**
It is considered 'good practice' to collect a baseline survey for the purposes of improving statistical power, assessing baseline randomised group balance, and correcting for possible attrition, as well as for the purposes of heterogeneity analysis at end-line. However, it is common in field experiments to randomise treatment status in the public domain to allow community and government scrutiny of the 'fairness' of allocation. This approach can create constraints on the timing of baseline survey implementation. We analyse whether public lottery allocation effects respondents' outcomes in a sample of villages in Niger.
