# Mike McRae — Site v2 (Astro)

This is a standalone Astro rebuild of the original site content.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Content

All content lives in `src/content/`:
- `pages/` (about, research, projects, cv)

Static assets are in `public/` (`images/`, `files/`, `CV/`).
